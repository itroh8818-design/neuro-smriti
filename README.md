## 🎮 Cognitive Games

| Game | Description | Skills Targeted |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 🧠 Memory Match | Flip and match card pairs with NER cultural images | Short-term memory, visual recall |
| 🔍 Pattern Recognition | Complete pattern sequences with shapes and colors | Logic, sequence memory |
| 📅 Daily Routine Recall | Order daily activities in correct sequence | Procedural memory, daily living skills |
| 👁️ Object Recognition | Identify objects from images | Visual recognition, naming |
| 🎯 Attention & Focus | Find the different item in a grid | Sustained attention, visual scanning |
| ❤️ Emotional Engagement | Match emotions to faces and scenarios | Emotional intelligence, empathy |

---

## 🧠 AI Adaptive Difficulty

The platform uses a rule-based AI engine that:

1. **Tracks performance** across 10 recent sessions per game type
2. **Analyzes metrics**: accuracy, response time, completion rate
3. **Adjusts difficulty** when 3+ consecutive high/low scores are detected
4. **Provides cognitive health scoring** combining all game types

Difficulty levels: **Easy** → **Medium** → **Hard**
